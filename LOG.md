# Development Log

## 2025-10-10

Designed and implemented Prisma schema for Platsbanken job integration. Updated Job, Company, JobRequirement, JobSourceLink, and JobContact models to match Platsbanken API structure, including support for occupation taxonomy, requirements (must_have/nice_to_have), location with PostGIS coordinates, and remote work detection. Removed unnecessary enums and tables (JobStatus, EmploymentType, WorkArrangement, ExperienceLevel, JobCategory, JobSkill, JobApplicationMethod) in favor of flexible string fields and direct relationships.

**Next:** Create PlatsbankenService with Effect to fetch jobs from API, transform using Effect Schema to map to our database models, and save jobs with proper upsert logic for Company and JobSourceLink relations.
