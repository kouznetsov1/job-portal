# Development Log

Implemented pagination with Stream.paginateChunkEffect and rate limit handling using catchTag, fetched 2100 jobs before hitting schema validation errors.

## 2025-10-10

Designed and implemented Prisma schema for Platsbanken job integration. Updated Job, Company, JobRequirement, JobSourceLink, and JobContact models to match Platsbanken API structure, including support for occupation taxonomy, requirements (must_have/nice_to_have), location with PostGIS coordinates, and remote work detection. Removed unnecessary enums and tables (JobStatus, EmploymentType, WorkArrangement, ExperienceLevel, JobCategory, JobSkill, JobApplicationMethod) in favor of flexible string fields and direct relationships.
